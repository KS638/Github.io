            <h2>About the Book</h2>
            <p>The world is, and has always been normal. It has been unchangeably normal for an unthinkable amount of time.</p>
             
            <p>Normality, however, is fragile. One bad day is all it takes and one bad day is all it took.</p> 
                
            <p>Ten years on from M-Day, Daniel Thorn is left to pick up the pieces. He is recruited for a mission that might help save modern civilization and bring about a new era of peace.</p>
            
            <p>Unfortunately, on an island of savage beasts and unforgiving monsters, Dan discovers things that unravel his allegiances and peace may not be an option. </p>

            <h2>About the Authors</h2>
            <p>We, a team of 3, have written this novella to sell and raise money for the Mark Evison Foundation.</p>
            <p>We are new writers & illustrators and have learnt a lot in writing our new book. We learnt how to develop a product, not just for ourselves, but for book lovers like us. We also learnt how to time manage to meet deadlines.</p>
            <p>Ibrahim is our main writer and developed most of the story in this novella.</p>
            <p>Kabir is our co-writer and editor who helped shape this book into its complete version</p>
            <p>Alex is the illustrator who designed the cover and extra pages</p>
            <p>We were really excited when the Foundation gave us the oppurtunity to stretch ourselves to write this novella, and we hope to raise money to further support any pupils who want to push their limits</p>
            <p>if you too want to support these pupils, please donate to our journey and the Mark Evison Foundation</p>
